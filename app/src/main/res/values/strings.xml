        Basically my full name is Towhidul Islam Sayon as my certificate. But for the sake of simplicity I use Towhid Soyon
        on all of my social sites. I am an Android Developer. For the last two years I am working on this sector. I have some proficiency in JAVA
         and that is why I choose this as my career.

        Right now I am fulfilling my B.Sc CSE Degree from Daffodil International University. And completed my HSC from Govt. Science College.
        Basically The main motivation is to build this app is actually to provide people the right solution for tree plantation. Planting trees
        without knowing its benefits will result in nothing. As a result to find a solution of this problem I made this app.

        Beside these, to make this app my Final year Defence supervisor Respected JA Polin Maam (Lecturer at DIU) played a vital role. She always
        guided me towards the best way to achieve success. I will be ever grateful to her.

        This project is also a part of my final Year Defence, So yeah that is all about me.
